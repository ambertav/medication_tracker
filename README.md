### Future Enhancements

- Calculate day supply information based on user's dosing input for each medication
- Countdown days remaining for each medication supply prior to needing to refill
- Alert the user to refill medications based on a notification schedule of the user's choosing, such as 3 days before or more
- Implement repeating of dose notifications based on time interval given, so that if a particular dose is to be given twice a day, the user may input the information once
- Inform user of when to administer the upcoming dose for any particular patient
- Log previous dosing history so that a user can reflect on changes to prescribed dosages for each medication
